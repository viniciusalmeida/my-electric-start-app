[Electric Clojure](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric) is "a signals DSL for fullstack web UI, with compiler-managed network sync."

This repository registers the study about serving Electric apps through a server configured using [ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) in a data-driven style upon [reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit). It consists of an example app based on the "official" [example app](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app) (at version [b347af77b7c32788acd117777f9d0a1e256d875e](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/electric-starter-app/tree/b347af77b7c32788acd117777f9d0a1e256d875e)).
